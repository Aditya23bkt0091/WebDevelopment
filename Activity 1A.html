        Hello! My name is <strong style="color: #ff6347;">Aditya</strong>, and I am passionate about learning and exploring new horizons. 
        Currently, I am pursuing a <em style="color: #87ceeb;"><u>Bachelor of Technology</u></em> specializing in Blockchain Technology at VIT Vellore, 
        one of the top engineering institutions in India. My academic journey has been marked by consistent performance, earning a merit 
        scholarship with a <strong style="color: #ffd700;">CGPA of 9.44</strong>. I am deeply intrigued by the transformative potential of blockchain 
        technology and how it can revolutionize industries like finance, healthcare, and supply chain.

    <div style="flex: 1; padding: 20px; margin: 10px; background-color: #333; border-radius: 15px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);">
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0;">
        Beyond academics, I am an avid sports enthusiast. During my school years, I represented my institution in <strong style="color: #ff6347;">handball</strong> at 
        the South Zonal level and played <strong style="color: #ff6347;">basketball</strong> at the state level. These experiences taught me the value of teamwork, 
        perseverance, and discipline. I also hold a blue belt in karate, which has equipped me with self-defense skills and an unyielding 
        spirit to tackle life's challenges. Sports have always been a cornerstone of my holistic development, complementing my academic pursuits.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0;">
        Professionally, I have had the privilege of interning at <strong style="color: #87ceeb;">BOSCH (RBAI)</strong>, where I gained hands-on experience in PCB 
        assembly and database management. This exposure allowed me to understand the practical applications of technology in real-world 
        scenarios. It also fueled my interest in innovative problem-solving and developing systems that enhance efficiency and productivity at the same time.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0;">
        My journey is not confined to academics and sports. I have actively participated in various workshops and seminars to expand my 
        horizons. My involvement in programs like <strong style="color: #87ceeb;">D-Talk</strong> enhanced my public speaking skills, allowing me to communicate ideas 
        effectively. I am also a firm believer in community service and have volunteered for initiatives that aim to uplift the underprivileged. 
        These experiences have shaped me into a well-rounded individual ready to take on challenges with confidence.
